**FINALLY got the repo to stick without bugging out.**

**Additonal Components, Themes, and Styled Icon Buttons work.**

**Got it working as intended with Bit.**

bittest also works and registers changes made to the Masthead component.
Since .bit is now in the .gitignore, you must git stash/git stash pop to maintain your local files after you pull to the master branch.
